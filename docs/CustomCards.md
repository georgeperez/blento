# Custom Cards

see `src/lib/cards` for how cards are made (and e.g. `src/lib/cards/EmbedCard/` and `src/lib/cards/LivestreamCard/` for examples of implementation).

Notes:

- Cards should be styled to work in light and dark mode (with dark: class modifier) as well as when cards are colorful (= bg-color-500 for the card) (with accent: modifier).
- Please test newly created cards both when editing (/your-user/edit) and in your user profile when saved (/your-user)
