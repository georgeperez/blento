# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are very welcome 🎉

For creating new cards see [here](CustomCards.md) (and check out [existing card ideas](CardIdeas.md))

## Development

```
git clone https://github.com/flo-bit/blento.git
cd blento
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## AI assisted development

You can submit PRs written with AI but please make sure:

- there's no extra unnecessary changes/unnecessary verbose code (keep it simple)
- you test everything yourself (in light/dark mode, with and without colored cards, in edit mode and not in edit mode)
